# Capstone project using Excel

Capstone Project: Home Delivery Data Analysis (Excel-Based)
Project Overview:
This capstone project focused on analyzing order-level data from a home delivery service to extract business insights and improve operational efficiency. The dataset included detailed customer orders, delivery performance metrics, and customer acquisition information.
Primary Tool Used:
Microsoft Excel â€“ for data cleaning, structured analysis, calculations, pivot tables, and visual dashboards.

Key Areas of Analysis:
Order-Level Analysis
Analyzed order distribution across time slots and delivery areas
Identified delivery zones with the highest growth in monthly order volumes
Calculated delivery charges and discounts as percentages of product amount across time slots and months

Completion Rate Analysis
Computed completion rates by slot and day of the week
Examined completion trends by product quantity and delivery area
Detected patterns that impact delivery success rates

Customer-Level Analysis
Calculated individual customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
Aggregated LTV by acquisition source and acquisition month
Analyzed average revenue per order by customer source and acquisition time
Identified trends in customer ratings based on slots, item count, and discounts

Delivery Performance Analysis
Measured average delivery times across time slots, delivery areas, and weekdays/weekends
Identified delays and patterns in delivery time by geography and schedule
Analyzed how delivery charges vary by time slot and region

ðŸ“˜ What I Learned:
Mastered advanced Excel functions (IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, DATE/TIME logic)
Built interactive dashboards and pivot tables for clear data presentation
Learned to calculate complex business metrics (LTV, completion rate, delivery time breakdown)
Gained experience in drawing insights from large datasets without using "Text to Columns"
Developed skills in presenting findings professionally with charts, summaries, and conditional formatting

ðŸ’¡ Project Outcome:
This Excel-based project helped me apply analytical thinking to solve real-world business problems using structured data. It enhanced my ability to create meaningful visualizations, calculate key KPIs, and communicate data-driven recommendations effectively.
